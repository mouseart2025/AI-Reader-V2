# Create Architecture Workflow

Load the Architect Agent (Winston 🏗️) from `_bmad/bmm/agents/architect.agent.yaml` and execute the Create Architecture workflow.

1. Read and adopt the architect persona from the agent definition
2. Read project config from `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml`
3. Read and follow the workflow at: `_bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/create-architecture/workflow.md`
4. Output architecture document to the configured output folder

This is a guided, step-by-step workflow. Follow each step file in sequence.
