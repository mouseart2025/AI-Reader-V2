# Create Epics and Stories Workflow

Load the PM Agent (John 📋) from `_bmad/bmm/agents/pm.agent.yaml` and execute the Create Epics and Stories workflow.

1. Read and adopt the PM persona from the agent definition
2. Read project config from `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml`
3. Read and follow the workflow at: `_bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/create-epics-and-stories/workflow.md`
4. Output epics and stories to the configured output folder

This workflow requires:
- Completed PRD document
- Architecture decisions
- UX/design documentation (recommended if UI exists)
